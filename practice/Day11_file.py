## If youâ€™re not using the with keyword, then you should call f.close() to close the file and immediately free up any system resources used by it.

##For reading lines from a file, you can loop over the file object. This is memory efficient, fast, and leads to simple code:
for line in f:
    print(line, end='')  #If you want to read all the lines of a file in a list you can also use list(f) or f.readlines().
    
with open('text.txt', 'r') as f:
    #print(f.readline()) ### read one line
    #print(f.read()) ### read all lines
    for line in f:
        if line.__contains__('two'):
            print(line, end='')
